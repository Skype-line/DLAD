This is the running instruction for exercise 3, problem 1 and 2.

1. set the config.yaml

For running problem 1, please set following arguments:

	data: 
		if_xyz_mlp: false

	model:
		if_xyz_mlp: false

	optimizer:
		Adam: false
	
	scheduler:
		milestones: [10, 20, 30]

	loss:
		if_iou_loss: false

	trainer: 
		resume_from_checkpoint: 

For running problem 2, please set:

	data: 
		if_xyz_mlp: true

	model:
		if_xyz_mlp: true

	optimizer:
		Adam: true
	
	scheduler:
		milestones: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]

	loss:
		if_iou_loss: true

For ablation studies, one could manipulate the settings including 'Adam', 'if_xyz_mlp' and 'if_iou_loss'.

2. run the code

Please look at README.md for detailed instructions.

Our code is additionally based on Rotated_IoU package, which needs to be installed before running the code. Although we have already incorporate the installation in train mode (see aws/train_in_tmux), we still would like to provide the installation instructions here:

	cd ~/code/utils/Rotated_IoU/cuda_op/
	python setup.py install

Then the code could be run following the original instructions.
